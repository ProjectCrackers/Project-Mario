# Security Policy

## Legacy Versions
These versions were from the first iteration of Project Mario when it was previously called **Super ELedlow Bros.**<br>
These versions are very depreciated and probably should be left in the dust. Most of these versions were deleted due to Wix being unfair and banning me two years ago without notice and without a reason. They are now lost media (excpet to that random Chinese archiver who's been archiving since v7.5.1-alpha that I've noticed).

1. The **Code.org version**: The [Code.org](https://studio.code.org/projects/gamelab/2PL0UqU5RnaOrofoq3X6SnWM0A-KU2QvAMfVlY-Jf3E/edit) version was created in 2023 before I was on GitHub. The version history on the project is incorrect as it says 2025 purely because I revisited it.
2. **v6.9.9 and lower**: These were versions that were on Wix. All of them got deleted as Wix not only deleted my account but my resources that I didn't have backed up for some stupid reason.
3. **v7.5.1-alpha**: This version used to exist but was deleted by me after I realized the files did not properly export, causing the game to be unplayable without a disassembly.
4. **v7.5.1-beta.1**: This version is undocumented. This was put there as it was when the story started actually representing itself. You can go through the 2023-24 commit history to find the source of this.
5. **v7.5.1-beta.2**: This version was removed due to a major security vulnerability that caused the game to be allowed to run malicious code.
6. **v7.5.1-beta.3**: This version only included source code.
7. **v7.5.1-beta.4**: This is the first GitHub release.
8. **v7.5.1-beta.5**: This is the second GitHub release.
